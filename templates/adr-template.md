# ADR-XXX: Title of the Decision

## Context
Describe the problem or need driving the decision. Provide background, technical constraints, and requirements. For example, "The system requires a scalable solution for handling user authentication across multiple services."

## Decision
State the decision made, including technical details. For example, "We will implement JWT-based authentication with OAuth 2.0 for secure and scalable user access."

### Technical Details
- Detail 1: e.g., "Technology: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)."
- Detail 2: e.g., "Framework: Keycloak for OAuth 2.0 integration."
- Detail 3: e.g., "Deployment: Kubernetes with Helm charts."

### Diagram

```
Optional: Replace with a relevant Mermaid diagram illustrating the decision, or remove this section if not applicable.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Benefit 1: e.g., "Improved scalability for user authentication."
  - Benefit 2: e.g., "Simplified integration with third-party services."
- **Negative**:
  - Risk 1: e.g., "Increased complexity in token management."
  - Risk 2: e.g., "Dependency on external identity provider."
- **Mitigations**:
  - Mitigation 1: e.g., "Implement token refresh mechanisms."
  - Mitigation 2: e.g., "Document integration procedures."

## Alternatives Considered
- **Alternative 1**: Description and why it was rejected. e.g., "SAML-based authentication: Rejected due to higher complexity and lower adoption."
- **Alternative 2**: Description and why it was rejected. e.g., "Session-based authentication: Rejected due to poor scalability."

## References
